# 🍽️ Grandma’s Recipes — Client Application

## Project Overview

Grandma’s Recipes is a full-stack web application that allows users to explore, manage, and organize recipes from multiple sources through a modern web interface.

The system combines:

- External recipes retrieved from the **Spoonacular API**
- Personal recipes created by users
- Shared **family recipes**

This repository contains the **client-side application**, built with **Vue.js**, responsible for rendering the UI, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend REST API.

The frontend dynamically displays recipe data, supports authenticated user actions, and provides a modular and responsive user experience.
